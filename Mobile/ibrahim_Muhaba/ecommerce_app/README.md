# Task 16: Improve Code Organization and Reusability

## Overview
This task focused on enhancing the Ecommerce appâ€™s codebase by improving organization, reducing duplication, and increasing reusability to boost maintainability and scalability.

## Changes Made

- **Reusable Error Classes**  
  Created `ServerException` and `CacheException` in `core/errors/exceptions.dart` for consistent and centralized error handling.

- **Centralized API Endpoints**  
  Introduced an `ApiConstants` class in `core/constants/api_constants.dart` that holds all API endpoint URLs to avoid duplication and simplify URL management.

- **Refactored Remote Data Source**  
  Updated `ProductRemoteDataSourceImpl` to:
  - Use the centralized API endpoints from `ApiConstants`.
  - Throw the reusable `ServerException` on HTTP errors.

- **Updated Unit Tests**  
  Modified remote data source tests to:
  - Use the new `ApiConstants` URLs.
  - Fix previous mocking issues.
  - Align with updated exception handling.

## Benefits
- Simplified API endpoint management via centralized constants.  
- Consistent error handling across data sources using custom exceptions.  
- Cleaner, more modular, and maintainable code.  
- Robust and reliable unit tests aligned with new code structure.
